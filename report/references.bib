	journal = {Quantum Science and Technology},
	abstract = {Machine learning is a promising application of quantum computing, but challenges remain for implementation today because near-term devices have a limited number of physical qubits and high error rates. Motivated by the usefulness of tensor networks for machine learning in the classical context, we propose quantum computing approaches to both discriminative and generative learning, with circuits based on tree and matrix product state tensor networks, that could already have benefits with such near-term devices. The result is a unified framework in which classical and quantum computing can benefit from the same theoretical and algorithmic developments, and the same model can be trained classically then transferred to the quantum setting for additional optimization. Tensor network circuits can also provide qubit-efficient schemes in which, depending on the architecture, the number of physical qubits required scales only logarithmically with, or independently of the input or output data sizes. We demonstrate our proposals with numerical experiments, training a discriminative model to perform handwriting recognition using a hybrid quantum-classical optimization procedure that could be carried out on quantum hardware today, and testing the noise resilience of the trained model.}

  abstract = {The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is reviewed from a quantum chemistry perspective. Starting from a general many-body wavefunction, a new representation of the wavefunction called the matrix product state (MPS) representation is introduced. An explicit form of an MPS wavefunction is obtained from recursive decompositions of the original wavefunction. Based on the MPS wavefunction, overlap and expectation values are efficiently evaluated with algorithms having polynomial cost. A polynomial cost ansatz for the ground-state energy and wavefunction is therefore formulated by applying the variational principle to an MPS wavefunction. As a result, the DMRG algorithm is naturally obtained from general quantum mechanics as a variational ansatz for a many-body wavefunction. It is also important that the MPS representation leads to a site-based mean-field theory from an analogy to Hartree–Fock theory, which is a particle-based mean-field theory. In this sense, a sweep algorithm in the original DMRG is understood as a self-consistent field procedure. Advanced algorithms, such as that using complementary operators, that incorporating sparsity due to symmetry, and the two-site algorithm, are also described to achieve the optimal computational complexity for the DMRG algorithm in quantum chemistry.}

  abstract = {Book Description: Gilbert Strang's textbooks have changed the entire approach to learning linear algebra -- away from abstract vector spaces to specific examples of the four fundamental subspaces: the column space and nullspace of A and A'. Introduction to Linear Algebra, Fourth Edition includes challenge problems to complement the review problems that have been highly praised in previous editions. The basic course is followed by seven applications: differential equations, engineering, graph theory, statistics, Fourier methods and the FFT, linear programming, and computer graphics. Thousands of teachers in colleges and universities and now high schools are using this book, which truly explains this crucial subject.},
