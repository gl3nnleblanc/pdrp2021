\section*{Introduction}
	\subsection*{Many-Body Wavefunctions as Tensors}
		Consider a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle. The particle's state is given by
		$\ket{\psi}\in\mathds{C}^2$, and for some computational basis
		$\{\ket{0}, \ket{1}\}$ we can write
		$$\ket{\psi}=\alpha\ket{0}+\beta\ket{1}$$
		with
		$$|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2=1.$$
		This is the principle of superpostion-- the particle is superposed
		between the two basis states $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$. Now if we add
		a second spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle, the many-body system
		$\ket{\Psi}$ is in some superposition of the four states
		$$\ket{\Psi}=\alpha\ket{00}+\beta\ket{01}+\gamma\ket{10}+\delta\ket{11}.$$
		Generally, for $N$ qubits (qudits) the system is fully
		parameterized by $2^N$ ($d^N$) complex numbers:
		$\ket{\Psi}\in\mathds{C}^{2^N}$. Notice the exponential scaling
		here. It is useful also to notice the natural bijection between
		the two spaces
		$$\mathds{C}^{2^N}\longleftrightarrow \mathds{C}^{2\times\cdots\times 2}$$
		meaning we can instead conceptualize $\ket{\Psi}$ as a
		\textit{tensor}:
		$$\ket{\Psi}\in\mathds{C}^{2\times\cdots\times2}$$
		where in this paper a tensor $\Psi$ is just a multidimensional
		array with some number of indices such that plugging in an
		assignment for each index spits out a complex number. More
		succinctly,
		$$\Psi_{i_1,i_2,\cdots,i_N}\in\mathds{C}$$
		A \textit{contraction} between two tensors $\Psi$ and $\Phi$ is
		a summation over a shared index:
		$$T_{i,j,l,m}=\sum_k\Psi_{i,j,k}\Phi_{l,k,m}$$
		is an example of a contraction. Note that dot products, matrix
		multiplication, and trace are all different vestiges of tensor
		contraction:
				\begin{align*}
				a\cdot b &=\sum_ka_kb_k\\
				(Ax)_{i} &=\sum_kA_{ik}x_k\\
				\Tr(A)&=\sum_kA_{kk}
			\end{align*}


	\subsection*{Tensor Networks}
	A \textit{tensor network} is an undirected graph whose nodes
	represent tensors and whose edges correspond to tensor indices. An
	edge between two tensors corresponds to a contraction along the
	depicted axis of each tensor. Use of this graphical language for
	representing quantum systems is attractive since it unveils relevant
	entanglement properties~\cite{TnIntro}.
	\begin{Figure}
		\center\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{./Figures/tensors.eps}
		\captionof{figure}{A graphical depiction of a scalar $c$, vector
		    $v_i$, matrix $M_{ij}$, and a tensor $T_{ijk}$ of rank three.}
		\label{tensor-graphics}
	\end{Figure}
	See figure~\ref{tensor-graphics} for a graphical depiction of
	tensors of rank zero to three. Each tensor is denoted as a node with
	free edges representing each index.

	Figure~\ref{tensor-contractions} depicts the previous examples (dot
	product, matrix multiplication, trace) of tensor contraction using
	this graphical language.
	\begin{Figure}
		\center\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{./Figures/contractions.eps}
		\captionof{figure}{A graphical depiction of three examples of
		    tensor contraction.}
		\label{tensor-contractions}
	\end{Figure}
	An example of an insight this graphical language provides is in
	proving trace cyclicality. The standard proof is as follows:
	\begin{align*}
		\Tr(ABC)&=\sum_{ijk}A_{ij}B_{jk}C_{ki}\\
						&=\sum_{ijk}C_{ki}A_{ij}B_{jk}\\
						&=\Tr(CAB)
	\end{align*}
	The tensor network proof is depicted in figure~\ref{trace}:
	\begin{Figure}
		\center\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{./Figures/trace.eps}
		\captionof{figure}{Proof of trace cyclicality.}
		\label{trace}
	\end{Figure}
	The graphical depiction of trace provides simpler insight into the
	cyclic structure of the underlying tensor contractions required to
	calculate $\Tr(ABC)$, and thus allows for a totally visual and
	immediately obvious proof of the invariance under cyclic
	permutations of $A$, $B$, and $C$.
